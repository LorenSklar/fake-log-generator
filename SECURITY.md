## Security Best Practices

When using Fake Log Generator:

1. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update the project dependencies
2. **Use in isolated environments**: Run the generator in isolated environments when possible
3. **Review generated data**: Be aware that generated data may contain sensitive patterns
4. **Secure file handling**: Ensure generated log files are stored securely
5. **Network security**: If using network features, ensure proper network security

## Security Considerations

### Data Generation
- Generated log entries are fake and should not contain real sensitive data
- The generator uses Faker library which provides realistic but fake data
- No real user data, IP addresses, or credentials are generated

### File Operations
- The CLI tool creates files based on user input
- Ensure proper file permissions and secure storage locations
- Be cautious with file paths to prevent path traversal issues

### Dependencies
- We regularly review and update dependencies
- Security advisories for dependencies are monitored
- Critical security updates are prioritized
